        "Q1.WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FUNCTION AND A METHOD IN PYTHON ?\n",
        "ANS.In Python, both functions and methods are blocks of reusable code, but they differ primarily in how they are defined and called:\n",
        "\n",
        "Function: A function is a standalone block of code that performs a specific task. It is defined independently of any class or object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "def my_function(arg1, arg2): return arg1 + arg2\n",
        "\n",
        "result = my_function(5, 3) print(result) # Output: 8 ```\n",
        "\n",
        "Method: A method is a function that is associated with an object or a class. It is defined inside a class and is typically called on an instance of that class. Methods often operate on the data within the object to which they belong.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass: def init(self, value): self.value = value\n",
        "\n",
        "def my_method(self, num):\n",
        "    return self.value * num\n",
        "obj = MyClass(10) result = obj.my_method(4) print(result) # Output: 40 ```\n",

        "Key Differences Summarized:\n",
        "\n",
        "Association: Functions are standalone; methods are associated with an object/class.\n",
        "Definition: Functions are defined outside a class; methods are defined inside a class.\n",
        "Calling: Functions are called by their name; methods are called on an object (e.g., object.method()).\n",
        "First Argument: Methods always take self (or the class itself for class methods/static methods) as their first argument, which refers to the instance of the class.\n",
